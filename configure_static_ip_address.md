**IMPORTANT NOTE**\
The `ip address add` command is to temporarily set an IP address on a network interface.\
This means the result of `ip address add` command, and also the results of other `ip` commands are non-persistent. They will be lost after the system is rebooted.\
Please use **nmcli** or **nmtui** to make the network configuration persistent!
